# Expedia-Hotel-Recommendations
We obtained dataset from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations). The goal of this work was to predict a userâ€™s hotel cluster preference from ten clusters. We stated by conducting a thorough exploratory analysis of interrelationships between variables including time dependencies. Then, tested a variety of Random Forest algorithms by performing grid search over tree size and depth. We found 100 trees with a max depth of 20 to be optimal which gave us .5 accuracy.
